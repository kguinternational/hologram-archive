  "conclusion": "The investigation of F₄ ⊂ E₆ revealed fundamental categorical structure: quotient and filtration operations are incompatible, explaining why the classical Lie algebra embedding cannot be realized as simple root subset inclusion. This 'negative' result is actually a positive finding, demonstrating the necessity of Lie algebra structure beyond root geometry. All 5 exceptional groups successfully constructed from Atlas, with 3 of 4 inclusions proven via categorical operations."
