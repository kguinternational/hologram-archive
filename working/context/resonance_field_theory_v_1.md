## A Unified Mathematical Framework for Reality as Computed Wave Interference

**Version 1.0 — UOR‑Aligned Foundational Document**  
*Unifying resonance, computation, and positive geometry on the 12,288‑element hologram*

## Abstract
Resonance Field Theory (RFT) models reality as interference among eight base oscillators evaluated over a finite substrate with **12,288** boundary basis elements (48×256). The framework is anchored by three **normative invariants**: **R96** (exactly 96 resonance classes from 256 selectors, 3/8 compression), **C768** (triple‑cycle conservation closures on a fair 768‑step schedule), and **Φ‑compatibility** (bulk↔boundary equivalence commuting with a boundary subgroup of order 2048). This document harmonizes the intuitive physics‑style narrative with the UOR/PrimeOS specifications, isolates non‑normative hypotheses, and provides acceptance criteria and test harnesses.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Thesis
Reality is modeled as a finite resonance computation:
- **Boundary lattice:** 48 pages × 256 bytes = **12,288** basis points.
- **Selectors:** eight toggles **b ∈ {0,1}⁸** drive resonance evaluation.
- **Resonance classes:** **96** distinct values (3/8 of 256) under unity‑pair normalization.
- **Triple cycle:** **768 = 16 × 48 = 3 × 256** enforces conservation closures.
- **Bulk ↔ boundary:** A constructive **Φ** identifies bulk states with boundary basis elements and preserves labels/invariants.

### 1.2 Core Principles
**P1. Wave–Arithmetic Equivalence.** Addition ↔ superposition; multiplication ↔ frequency mixing; factorization ↔ frequency decomposition.  
**P2. Truth ≙ Conservation.** Valid derivations preserve resonance budgets; contradictions violate closures.  
**P3. Holographic Correspondence.** Boundary suffices to reconstruct bulk via **Φ**; the 96‑track boundary semiring **C₉₆** governs budgets.

> **Normativity note.** RFT is **normative** where it states R96, C768, Φ, and acceptance tests. Physics‑level analogies (e.g., forces, consciousness) are **non‑normative**; they live in appendices.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 Boundary Lattice and Selectors
- **Pages** P = ℤ/48, **Bytes** B = ℤ/256, **Index** G = P × B (|G| = 12,288).
- **Selectors** S = {0,1}⁸ with a **pinned/inert** toggle and a **unity pair** at indices u,v satisfying α_u·α_v = 1.

### 2.2 Resonance Function (Pair‑normalized)
For b ∈ S and amplitudes α_i > 0 with α_u α_v = 1 and α₀ = 1 (inert):
- **Resonance:** R(b) = ∏ α_i^{b_i} (evaluated with **pair normalization** so the unity pair contributes 1 when both bits are 1).
- **R96 Theorem (operational):** |Im R| = 96 (exact), yielding **compression 96/256 = 3/8**.
- **Multiplicity structure:** exactly **64** classes have **3** preimages; **32** classes have **2** preimages (64×3 + 32×2 = 256).

> **Implementation.** Provide `enumerate_R96()` returning labels, multiplicities, and an audit log; acceptance requires the 96 count and the {2:32, 3:64} split.

### 2.3 Coherence Norm and Clifford Lens (Non‑normative)
A Clifford lens (e.g., Cl(8)) organizes selector‑graded components and supplies an invariant coherence norm ‖·‖_c. This is a **helpful model**, not a conformance obligation. Use only where it aids analysis; invariants are boundary‑first.

---

## 3. Triple‑Cycle Conservation (C768)

### 3.1 Canonical Fair Schedule (CFS‑768)
A **fair** schedule σ_CFS : {0..767} → G is fixed by
- p(t) = t mod 48,  b(t) = t mod 256,  σ_CFS(t) = (p(t), b(t)).
This yields **16** hits per page and **3** per byte with balanced prefixes.

### 3.2 Closed Forms
Let R(b) as above and define the triple‑cycle sum and variance:
- **Conservation constant:**  C₇₆₈ = ∑_{t=0}^{767} R(b(t)) = 3 · ∑_{b∈{0,1}⁸} R(b) = 3·∏_{i=0}^7 (1+α_i).
- **Mean:** μ = C₇₆₈ / 768 = (1/256)·∏_{i}(1+α_i).  
- **Variance:** Var₇₆₈ = (1/256)·∏_{i}(1+α_i²) − μ².

> **Reference α‑bank.** For the canonical α set used in tooling, C₇₆₈ evaluates to **687.110133051847…**. Implementations MUST match within published tolerances.

### 3.3 Acceptance
`check_C768()` MUST verify (i) fairness, (ii) closed‑form equalities for S₀,S₁,S₂ (sum/first/second moments), and (iii) tolerance bounds over required observables (constant, page‑indicator, byte‑indicator).

---

## 4. Φ‑Compatibility and Boundary Subgroup

### 4.1 Boundary Subgroup (Order 2048)
Use a finite subgroup **U_ref ⊂ Aut(G)** generated by 11 commuting involutions (3 on pages by XORing bits 1,2,4; 8 on bytes by XORing bits 2^k, k=0..7). Then |U_ref| = 2¹¹ = **2048**. Publish generators and a word solver for orbit reduction.

### 4.2 Master Isomorphism Φ
A constructive isomorphism **Φ: A_{7,3,0} × ℤ₂¹⁰ → G** satisfies: (i) boundary equivariance with U_ref, (ii) tiling of G by orbits, (iii) preservation of resonance class labels. Implement **NF‑Lift** to canonicalize bulk lifts and expose a boundary‑first API.

---

## 5. Six‑Level Tetrahedral Rhythm (Presentation Layer)
The 4→16→64→256→1024→4096×3 rhythm presents **12,288 = 3×4⁶**. Names of higher‑D polytopes are **non‑normative**; attach each level to invariants:

| Level | Count | Attachment |
|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 4 | Unity quartet / Klein window for pair normalization |
| 2 | 16 | Page cadence within 768 (16/page) |
| 3 | 64 | R96 multiplicity split (64 classes with 3 preimages) |
| 4 | 256 | Byte modulus; per‑cycle closures |
| 5 | 1024 | Atlas tensor factor (12,288 = 12 × 1024), Φ‑neutral |
| 6 | 4096×3 | Top tetrahedral packaging of the full basis |

---

## 6. Logic & Budgets (C₉₆)
Adopt a 96‑track semiring **C₉₆** for proof budgets. Budget 0 denotes truth/conservation. Provide crush morphism `cr: C₉₆ → Bool` (conservative collapse). Proof transport preserves budgets; Boolean gates are conservative at budget 0.

---

## 7. Non‑Normative Mappings (Physics & Mind)
> The following are **interpretive lenses**; they MUST NOT be used for conformance.
- **Spacetime lens:** time ↔ cycle phase; space ↔ page coordinate; metric from second‑derivative structure of resonance fields.  
- **Gauge‑force analogies:** U(1)/SU(2)/SU(3) patterns as symmetry lenses on resonance classes.  
- **Consciousness lens:** self‑referential resonance loops (awareness/memory/thought as resonance transforms).

---

## 8. Conformance & Test Harnesses

### 8.1 Required APIs
- `enumerate_R96(cfg) → (labels, multiplicities, audit)`  
- `check_C768(schedule, observables) → PASS/FAIL`  
- `verify_Phi_compat(Phi, Ugens) → PASS/FAIL`

### 8.2 Audit Bundle (Machine‑Readable)
Publish config (unity anchors, schedule id, generator digest, hash salt), R96 results (count, multiplicities, representative digests), C768 closures (S₀,S₁,S₂), Φ certificates (group order, commutation logs, tiling proof sketch).

---

## 9. Theorems (Normative Statements)
**Thm 9.1 (R96).** With α₀=1 and α_u α_v=1, |Im R|=96; compression = 3/8.  
**Thm 9.2 (C768).** On any fair 768‑schedule, C₇₆₈ = 3·∏(1+α_i); mean/variance match closed forms.  
**Thm 9.3 (Φ).** There exists Φ: A_{7,3,0}×ℤ₂¹⁰ ≅ G commuting with U_ref; orbits partition G and preserve class labels.  
**Thm 9.4 (Minimality 12,288).** Any N < 12,288 fails modular tiling, R96 exactness, C768 closures, positive orientation, or Φ‑tiling.

## 12. Generalized Formulation and Robustness

### 12.1 Oscillator Bank: Parameter Space and Constraints
Let A be the set of all 8‑tuples alpha = (alpha_0,...,alpha_7) of positive reals satisfying:
1) alpha_0 = 1 (inert channel).  
2) There exists a unity pair {u,v} with alpha_u * alpha_v = 1.  
3) All other channels are unconstrained except positivity.

Selectors are b in {0,1}^8 with one pinned bit (to break sign equivalence). The pair‑normalized resonance map R: {0,1}^8 -> R_{>0} is defined by
R(b) = product over i of alpha_i^{b_i}, followed by collapsing the unity pair so that b_u = b_v = 1 contributes factor 1.

**Key point:** The **count** of resonance classes (96) and the 64/32 multiplicity split are **independent of the numeric values** of alpha as long as the above constraints hold and pair‑normalization plus boundary orbits are applied. Numeric alpha values only affect the embedding of labels into amplitudes, not the labels themselves.

### 12.2 Gauge and Equivalence Transformations
The following transformations leave class labels invariant and therefore preserve all conformance checks:
- **Unity rescale gauge:** For any t>0, set alpha_u <- t*alpha_u and alpha_v <- alpha_v/t.  
- **Channel permutation:** Permute indices 0..7 simultaneously in selectors and alpha.  
- **Non‑unity reciprocation:** Map alpha_k <- 1/alpha_k while toggling the pinned bit’s convention; this corresponds to swapping a channel with its dual.  
- **Boundary relabeling:** Any action from the boundary subgroup U_ref on G.

Implementations MUST document which gauges they fix when publishing audit bundles; recommended: sorted channel order by log(alpha_i) and a fixed unity pair (u,v).

### 12.3 Robustness Under Perturbations
Let log alpha_i = r_i and consider small perturbations r_i -> r_i + epsilon_i. Because labels come from orbit‑reduced selectors rather than numeric thresholds, there exists a delta>0 such that for all perturbations with |epsilon_i| < delta the R96 labels and the 64/32 split are unchanged. Only the numeric embedding of labels moves smoothly. This ensures stable conformance under floating‑point noise.

### 12.4 Minimality of Eight Channels
With fewer than 8 toggles, the selector space has size < 256, which fails the byte‑axis modulus and the triple‑cycle factorization 768 = 3 * 256. Therefore 8 is minimal for simultaneously achieving (i) byte modulus 256, (ii) R96 compression 3/8, and (iii) a fair 768‑schedule with 16/page and 3/byte.

### 12.5 Why 3/8 Is Canonical (Sketch)
Pair‑normalization and the pinned bit remove two degrees of freedom from the raw 8‑toggle space; orbit reduction under U_ref collapses further. The resulting quotient has exactly 96 elements; equivalently 96/256 = 3/8. This quotient count is invariant across the oscillator bank A described above.

### 12.6 Multiplicity Structure 64/32 (Sketch)
Let rho be the map from normalized selectors to class labels. Stabilizers under U_ref yield two generic orbit sizes after normalization, producing preimage multiplicities of 2 and 3. Counting arguments over the normalized domain give exactly 64 classes of multiplicity 3 and 32 classes of multiplicity 2, summing to 256 total selectors.

### 12.7 Canonical Alpha‑Bank (Example, Non‑normative)
Provide at least one example alpha vector for reproducible numeric embeddings (useful for demonstrations; not required for acceptance):
- alpha_0 = 1.000000  
- alpha_1 = 1.839287  
- alpha_2 = 1.618034  
- alpha_3 = 0.500000  
- alpha_4 = 0.159155  
- alpha_5 = 6.283185  
- alpha_6 = 0.200000  
- alpha_7 = 0.014135  
Unity pair (alpha_4, alpha_5) satisfies alpha_4 * alpha_5 = 1.

### 12.8 Numeric Tolerances
To avoid false fails due to rounding when checking closures and canonical constants:
- Use at least 128‑bit integer accumulators for S0, S1, S2 under C768.  
- For floating comparisons (e.g., product(1+alpha_i)), adopt max of:  
  - relative tolerance 1e‑12, and  
  - absolute tolerance 1e‑12.  
Publish tolerances with the audit bundle; stricter tolerances are allowed.

### 12.9 Data Interchange and Reproducibility
Audit bundles MUST include: (i) unity pair indices, (ii) chosen gauges, (iii) generator list and digest for U_ref, (iv) schedule id (CFS‑768 or equivalent) and its digest, (v) class labels with stable hashes, (vi) numeric alpha vector if provided, and (vii) exact S0,S1,S2 integers.

## 13. Formal Axioms and Consequences

### 13.1 Axioms
A1. Boundary lattice G has size 48 * 256 with fair schedules of length 768.  
A2. There exists a unity pair in the oscillator bank and an inert channel.  
A3. The resonance classification after pair‑normalization and U_ref orbit reduction yields exactly 96 labels.  
A4. There exists a boundary‑first equivalence Phi mapping bulk states to G, commuting with U_ref.  

### 13.2 Consequences
C1. Compression bound 3/8 is exact and saturable.  
C2. Triple‑cycle closures S0,S1,S2 are schedule‑predictable and integer‑exact for CFS‑768.  
C3. Any two implementations that agree on gauges and generators produce identical labels and multiplicities (up to relabeling).
